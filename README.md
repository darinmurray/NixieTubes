A deceptively simple clock emulating vintaeg Nixie tubes. 

Everything is completely created with HTML/CSS/Jquery-Javascript.

No images are used in this clock. 


Outcomes:

Use pure CSS/jQuery-Javascript to illustrate objects that would normaly be injected as an image.


Make a working clock with Military/24hr time opton to show use of the tubes.
